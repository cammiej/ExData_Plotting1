## Exploratory Data Analysis, Course Project 1

This is my submission for the first course project in Exploratory Data Analysis with two entries for each plot: one R code and one png of the plot generated by the code.  The working directory is set in the beginning of the code and the plots are generated in that directory.
* plot1.R and plot1.png
* plot2.R and plot2.png
* plot3.R and plot3.png
* plot4.R and plot4.png
